## Project Description
Our project is to develop a web application for hosting and participating in volunteering events. The app will allow users or organizations to signup and create volunteer events with specific information. The app will keep a record of these events along with each registered volunteer.

We will implement the front-end of our web application using Angular and Firebase for database management.

## Build and Continuous Integration
As we are using Firebase for our web applicationâ€™s backend database, we do not need a separate build tool such as Maven or Gradle. For continuous integration we will use Travis CI.

## Automated Unit and Story Testing
We will be using Cucumber.js to execute Gherkin story tests for our backend. Our story tests are associated with project backlog items and available within our /story-tests directory.


Note: This ReadMe will be updated accordingly as our project progresses.
